## Promotional Campaign: *Paws for a Cause*

A socially conscious campaign that turns every drink into a donation:
- $0.25 from each customization goes to local animal shelters

- Branded tag cards encourage social sharing and community building  

## Experience Design

HoneyLu’s focuses on creating a cozy, emotionally rich environment:

- Loyalty rewards for both humans and dogs  
- Optional photo ops and seasonal drink themes  

## Loyalty Program

Every 5 dog drinks earns a free Pup Cup or treat. Because loyalty should be rewarded with tail wags and happy humans.
